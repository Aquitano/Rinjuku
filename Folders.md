# Folders

Folders are a way to organize your files. They are a special type of file that can contain other files and folders. They are also known as directories.

## +Index
The **+Inbox** folder is typically used as a temporary storage location for newly created or recently acquired files.
The purpose of the Inbox folder is to act as a holding area for new files until they can be properly organized and placed into their respective folders. This helps to keep the main file structure organized and free of clutter.

## Archive
The **Archive** folder is a container for a collection of subfolders that are used to store different types of data that have been archived for later reference or backup purposes. The purpose of this folder is to provide a centralized location for archived data, allowing for efficient organization and easy access to the data when needed.

### Backup
The **Backup** folder is specifically designated for storing backup copies of various forms of data storage. This includes backup copies from hard drives, USB sticks, and online services. This folder is crucial in ensuring the safety and security of important data and files, as it allows for easy retrieval in the event of data loss or corruption. With this folder in place, users can rest assured that their data is safe and secure.

### Social Media
The **Social Media** folder is intended for storing backup copies of social media content such as Twitter threads, Instagram posts, and any other similar content.
